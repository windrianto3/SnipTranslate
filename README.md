## Setting up the API token
This application requires you to have a DeepL API token stored in the `.env` file to make translation API requests. To setup:
1. To obtain the API, create an account with DeepL, select the free plan and obtain your API
2. Create the environment file `.env` in the root of the cloned repository
3. In `.env`, add the line `"api-token = <YOUR DEEPL API TOKEN:fx>"` with your API token.
